# Bomblab

___

[Bomblab](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~csong/cs165/17/lab1.html) is another crackme type reverse engineering challenge. As I worked through the IOLI Crackme challenges, I saw many blog posts referencing bomblab, so I wanted to give it a try myself. This challenge contains five phases. Pass them all, diffuse the bomb; fail and the bomb explodes. I will be using radare2 to complete this challenge.

Let's jump in by first looking at **main**:

**main** is too long to show in one image, but it contains five sections of code very similar functionality: print a message, take user input, send input to a subroutine. Time to crack phase 1.

## Phase 1

We see in main that this phase calls the function **phase_strcmp**; let's check out the disassembly:

![Image](/images/bomblab/1_phase_strcmp.png)

We quickly see that the disassembler shows an interestingly named variable. In the comments, it prints out the value for us: "What is your mother's maiden name?".

Too easy. On to phase 2.

## Phase 2

Based on the hint, we can assume that the answer is rock, paper, or scissors. We'll look at the function **phase_funcall**:

![Image](/images/bomblab/2_phase_funcall.png)

A little more complicated than last time, but as expected the function passes the strings "rock", "paper", and "scissors" to a subroutine **sym.func_game**.

Lots of **mov** instructions in the beginning, but what's important to note is that the function is comparing our input to the strings passed in above, each of which is contained in an array and accessed by the counter variable *ebx*. 

**strings_not_equal** returns 1 when the compared words are not the same, and 0 when they are the same. Following the *jmp* instructions, we see that the only way to pass the phase is when we guess the right word AND *ebx*=2. Three words are stored in the array, array indices start at zero, thus the correct word will be the 3rd word in the array. After setting a breakpoint, I find that the third word in the array is "paper"; let's see if it works:

## Phase 3

The next test happens in **phase_password**:

![Image](/images/bomblab/3_phase_password.png)

From the hint we can assume that the password will be some form of the string "password"; let's see if we can find it in the code. 

Following execution into **strings_equal**, I check the registers at the first call to **string_length** and find:

![Image](/images/bomblab/3_password_found.png)

Boom. On a roll! ..but that password doesn't work. Back to the disassembly. 

Upon checking the registers, I noticed that *arg_14h* contains our input, and *arg_18h* contains the string I just found; thus the second call to **string_length** is calculating the length of the key. We know that the return value of this function will be stored in *eax*. Notice that upon returning, the return value gets decremented by 1. Then the length of our input is compared to this number, and then each byte is compared to eachother. If we need a string of length 8 instead of 9, let's see if we can remove on character from the string I found earlier:

Nice, got it. Let's keep moving.

## Phase 4

From main, we see that our input will be passed to **sym.phase_quick**. Let's take a look at this function:

![Image](/images/bomblab/4_phase_quick.png)

The new stack frame is set up in the beginning, and then we see our input passed to the subroutine **read_six_numbers**. 

![Image](/images/bomblab/4_read_six_numbers.png)

**read_six_numbers** is fairly straightforward, it takes our input and ensures it is greater than five words in length. We can safely ignore the beginning block of *mov* and *lea* instructions.

Returning to **sym.phase_quick**, we see a *cmp* and *jns* block. The *jns* instruction was new to me, but all it means is "jump to *0x804924d* if the *Signed* flag is not set;" in other words, jump to the specified address if src > dst. Following this jump, we find a loop through the first six words we entered. On the first iteration, the function moves a 1 into eax and adds it to the first word we entered. It then compares that to the second word we entered, continuing the loop if equal, detonating the bomb otherwise.

Let's enter some numbers. Assume we enter a *1* as the first word; according to the algorithm, our second word needs to be *2*. On the next iteration of the loop, *ebx* has been incremented by 1, thus the algorithm will begin with the second word we entered. In our case this will be 2. *eax* still contains the sum from the last iteration (2), so after this addition, *eax* contains 4. So our third word needs to be 4. Let's make a table:

1st Word: 1
2nd Word: 1 + 1 = 2
3rd Word: 2 + 2 = 4
4th Word: 4 + 3 = 7
5th Word: 7 + 4 = 11
6th Word: 11 + 5 = 16

Let's see if got it right: "1 2 4 7 11 16"

## Phase 5

Onto the last phase. Let's look at the function phase_jump:

![Image](/images/bomblab/5_phase_jump.png)

We see a call to **sscanf** and then a *cmp* instruction with the return value; if the value is less than or equal to one, the bomb explodes. After setting a breakpoint on the *cmp* statement, I find that eax contains the number of arguments we input to this phase. So we know that we need to input at least two arguments.

Assuming we pass two arguments, we see another *cmp* statement. *local_18h* contains our first argument, and it cannot be greater than 7. We then move that argument into eax and make a jump based on its value. I'll input a 6 and a bogus value and see what happens:

![Image](/images/bomblab/5_phase_jump_2nd.png)

Inputting a 6 moves 0x146 (326) into *eax*, which then gets compared to our second argument (*local_1ch*). So we know that our second argument needs to be 326.

Bomb diffused.
