# CrackMe0x04

___

We'll start by running the program:

Looks the same as the last program; let's dive into the code.

![Image](/images/crackme0x04/main_pdf.png)

Starting with the **main** function, we see (as expected) similar code to what we've seen before. A few print statements, a call to **scanf** for user input, and then a call to the **check** function. It is reasonable to expect that **scanf** returns input in *local_78h*, but I will set a breakpoint and verify:

The function stores input in *local_78h* encoded as ascii; with this knowledge we'll continue to the **check** function.

We can see from the notes that **check** expects an argument, namely *arg_8h*, which we would expect is the user input. I'll check:

Next we see a call to **strlen** (@0x0804849e), which calculates the length of the user input and compares it to *local_ch*, exiting or continuing based on its value.

I'll set a breakpoint here (@0x080484a6) and discuss the purpose of *local_ch*.

Assuming execution continues, the function adds *local_ch* to the *arg_8h* pointer and then accesses *arg_8h*:

Jumping ahead a few instructions (@0x080484f7), we see *local_ch* incremented and then an unconditional jump back to the **strlen** call. Then the process repeats.

What we gather from this behavior is that *local_ch* is used as an index for the string that the user passes. This function processes our string one byte at a time, and *local_ch* is what keeps track of the current byte.

___

Continuing from our breakpoint above (@0x080484a6), the program takes the current byte, loads it into *local_dh* (@0x080484b1), and then passes it to **sscanf**. In high level terms, **sscanf** takes the byte (ascii) and converts it to an integer, storing the converted value in *local_4h*. This value is added to the current value of *local_8h* (persistent through each iteration of the loop) and then checked against *0xf* (15); if the values are equal, the function prints the *Password Ok* string, else execution returns to the beginning of the loop at the call to **strlen** (@0x0804849e).

Let's take a step back. A high level overview of what this program does:
1. Takes input from the user and treats it as a string.
2. Converts each byte of that string to a digit.
3. Adds those digits together.
4. If the digits add together to equal 15, we get *Password Ok*.

Let's give it a shot.

Done!
