# CrackMe0x05

___

Let's run the program:

![Image](/images/crackme0x05/wrong_pw.png)

Again it looks similar to what we've seen before. Analyzing the **main** function, we see some print statements, a call for user input, and then a call to another **check** function. We'll start our analysis there:

![Image](/images/crackme0x05/check_function.png)

**check** takes an argument, the user input string, and calculates its length. Then like [CrackMe0x04](/2018/02/25/crackme0x04), the function iterates through the bytes of the string, converts them to integers, and sums them together. This time the values need to add to 0x10 or 16 (decimal); assuming they do, the function passes the string to **parell**.

**parell** contains another call to **sscanf**, this time taking our entire string and converting it to an integer. Then we see a logical **AND** operation between that integer and 1, grabbing the lowest bit from the integer and **test**ing it against itself. The **test** instruction "AND's" the operands together and checks the result flags for the zero flag (ZF), only returning ZF when the operands are equal to 0. If the **test** instruction does not set ZF, then we get the Password Incorrect message. So we know that the lowest byte of our input needs to be 0x00. 

From the last walkthrough, we know that our input password needs to be a combination of the digits 0-9 (other input will throw off the conversions between ASCII and integers). We know that our digits need to add together to 0x10, And that the lowest bit of our input needs to be a 0. Let's give it a shot.

##### Potential C Source Code (?)

___

```c
void parell(String input)
{
	int sum = sscanf(input);
	sum &= 1;
	if (sum == 0) {
		printf("Password OK!\n");
		exit();
	}
	return;
}

void check(String input)
{
	int length = strlen(input);
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i=0; i<length; i++) {
		int current = sscanf(i);
		sum += current;
		if (sum == 16) {
			parell(input);
			return;
		}
	}
	printf("Password Incorrect!\n");
	return;
} 


int main()
{
	printf("IOLI Crackme Level 0x05\n");
	printf("Password: ");
	scanf(input);
	check(input);
	return 0;
}

```
