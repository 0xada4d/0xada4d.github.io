# CrackMe0x07

___

Let's run the program:

![Image](/images/crackme0x07/wrong_pw.png)

Nothing new or interesting. Analyzing the **main** function, we see another reference to our environment variables (*arg_10h*), so we'll keep an eye on that. Our input is stored in *local_78h* and then passed to a subroutine **strlen_5b9**.

![Image](/images/crackme0x07/call_to_strlen5.png)

This subroutine calculates the length of our input, then takes each byte and calculates the sum. The sum needs to be 0x10 or 16 for execution to continue. Assuming our input meets this condition, we see a call to the address *0x804542*.

![Image](/images/crackme0x07/strlen5_beg.png)

The next step is familiar. The instructions beginning at *0x804542* take our input as a whole and convert it to an integer. This integer is then placed on the stack and execution continues to the instructions at address *0x80484b4*.

![Image](/images/crackme0x07/8542.png)

As could be expected from our observation in the **main** function, the instruction block highlighted in red loops through our environment variables, looking for a variable **LOLO** once again. Upon finding the variable, it places a 1 at address *0x804a02c* and *ebp-8*, with *ebp-8* passed as the return value.

A 1 is the return value we need, as a 0 would cause execution to return to **strlen_5b9** without giving us the *Password_OK* message. Moving on, our input converted to an integer gets "ANDed" with 1, loading the lowest bit into *eax*. If this bit is not zero, the program exits. If it is zero, the program checks the value stored in *0x804a02c* for a 1. If we have done things correctly this will print *Password_OK*.

So what we've gathered is that this program is essentially the same as **crackme0x06**, the difference being the program layout. I'll list the requirements:

1. ASCII string made up of digits 0-9
2. Bytes in string add to 0x10
3. Environment variable named LOLO

Let's give it a shot:

### Potential C Source Code (?)

```c

extern char **environ;

int unnamed2(int input)
{
	int i=0;
	do {
		string current = environ[i];
		int r = strncmp(current, "LOLO", 3);
		if (r != 0) { 
			continue; 
		}
		else {
			return 1;
		}
	} 
	while (environ[i] != NULL)
	return 0;
}

void unnamed1(string input)
{
	int sum = sscanf(input);
	int r = dummy(sum);
	if (r = 0) {
		return;
	}
	else {
		for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
			input &= 1;
			if (input == 0)
			{
				printf("Password OK!\n")
				exit(0);
			}
			else {
				return;
			}
		}
	}
}

void strlen_5b9(string input)
{
	int length = strlen(input);
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i=0; i<length; i++) {
		int current = sscanf(i);
		sum += current;
		if (sum == 16) {
			parell(input);
			printf("Password Incorrect!\n")
			return;
		}
	}
	printf("Password Incorrect!\n");
	return;
} 


int main()
{
	printf("IOLI Crackme Level 0x07\n");
	printf("Password: ");
	scanf(input);
	strlen_5b9(input);
	return 0;
}

```
