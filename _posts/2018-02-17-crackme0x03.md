# CrackMe0x03

___

Let's start by running the program and getting an idea of how it works:

Very simple, just takes input, checks it against the correct password, and prints output. Let's open the program with Cutter and look at the **\_main** function:

In the beginning we're given the layout of the stack, so we'll keep track of it:

There's a lot going on in the first half of our function, but for my purposes nothing crucial happens until the return from the last call to **\_printf** (0x004013d1). Beginning at the next instruction we see *$eax* loaded with the address of a local variable, followed by a hexadecimal value loaded into *$esp*, and then a call to the **\_scanf** function. Lets look at the documentation for **\_scanf** to make sure we understand whats going on. **\_scanf** expects user input, taking two arguments: the first declares the expected format of the input, and the second is a variable that stores the input. We can safely assume that our input will be stored in the local variable *local_4h*, and that the password is a number (%d). 

Continuing on, we see values loaded into the other local variables and some mathematical operations on those values. The important thing to note is that after these operations:

*local_8h* = 582

*local_ch* = 582\*582 = 338,724 

*local_4h_2* = 338,724

Following on we see the *$esp* register overwritten with the value of *local_4h*. Then execution passes to **\_test**, which pops the next instruction address (0x0040141b) onto the stack as a return address, modifying the stack frame which now looks like:

We know where the user input is stored, now we need to find the comparison between the correct password and the user supplied value. Sounds like that should take place in **\_test**.

Continuing through the preamble, lets examine the stack. After the usual frame setup and memory allocation, the stack now resembles:

The next instructions load the variable *arg_8h* into the *$eax* register, then compare its value to *arg_ch*. Its safe to assume this is the comparison we're looking for. In the notes given to us before the preamble, we see that *arg_8h* is located at *ebp+8* which according to our stack chart is the user supplied input - we know then that *arg_ch* must hold the password. *arg_ch* is stored at *ebp+c*, which contains *local_ch*. What is the value of *local_ch*? We calculated it when we looked at the main function:

*local_ch* = 582\*582 = 338,724

Let's give it a shot:
