# CrackMe0x06

___

Running the program doesn't show anything new:

We'll start our analysis in **check**. We see that the program expects ASCII characters again, as it parses them byte by byte and calculates the sum. If the sum is 0x10 or 16, the function passes our input to **parell**:

**parell** passes our input to **sscanf** again, this time converting the whole ASCII string to a number. It loads that number into *esp* and then calls **dummy**.
