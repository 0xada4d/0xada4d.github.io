# CrackMe0x06

___

Running the program doesn't show anything new:

We'll start our analysis in **check**. We see that the program expects ASCII characters again, as it parses them byte by byte and calculates the sum. If the sum is 0x10 or 16, the function passes our input to **parell**:

**parell** passes our input to **sscanf** again, this time converting the whole ASCII string to a number. It loads that number into *esp* and then calls **dummy**.

Let's take a deeper look at **dummy**:

In the beginning we see *local_4h* acting as an iterator. The function loads its value into *eax*, then shifts its value left by two bits. We then see a **cmp** instruction, comparing the new iterator value + the value stored in *local_ch* to 0. So with each iteration of the loop, the function compares `local_ch + iterator*4` to 0; looks like were dealing with a list of 4-byte values. Let's look at *local_ch*

Ok, weird. It contains a reference to LS_COLORS, which is an environment variable. Let's keep moving.

The function copies our current iterator into *ecx*, then increments the original value. Next we see the call to **strncmp**, comparing 3 characters of the current string, *local_ch*, to the hardcoded string *"LOLO"*. If the values are not equal, the loop continues, otherwise it sets *local_8h_2* (the return value) to 1. Looking back at **parell** we see that we need the return value of **dummy** to be 1 or else the function jumps to the leave instruction:

Let's continue to the next loop and check *local_ch*:

Sure enough, the function is looping over our environment variables. Let's set an environment variable to match the *"LOLO"* string, and see if we make it to the "return value = 1" instruction at *0x08048505*.

And we do. Let's follow execution back to **parell**:

We almost have it. Next the function enters a new loop, testing if the first bit of our input, after being converted to an integer, is 0 - if it is, we get the password correct message. Let's convert my go-to password (1690) to an integer: 0x69a. The first bit of this integer is 0, so I'll give it a shot:

Got it!
